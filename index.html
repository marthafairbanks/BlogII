Yeah that's about all I got. Are you still reading? That's a little weird. I would have stopped. Is this like a stalking situation? Should I call the police? Wait. What if this is just the opposite and I am being the weirdo who assumes someone wants to listen to her. I guess the internet has made the whole talking to yourself thing seem a little less lonely.</p>

					<h3>Day 6: Already I'm changing everything</h3>

						<p class="caption">This is what I look like but less cute and more confused.</p>
						
						<p>Oh hey! What's happening? So I changed up this blog post a little and used bootstrap for the formatting. Overall bootstrap is really simple. The 12 column layout makes a ton of sense to me. Which is really cool because very few things make sense to me. Unfortunately, there are still a few things I am hung up on. Orginally, I had all these great plans like I was going to make a cute little menu bar when the page was viewed on a screen smaller than a laptop but I couldn't get it to work. I mean I got the columns to hide when you scale down just fine but I had a hard time doing the opposite. I'm sure it something simple so I'm not too worried but I just wanted this page to be cooler than it is. I'll figure out how to do it tomorrow.</p>

						<p>I did get to do something useful though. The foating box on the right hand side will actually close if you click the x. Also technically if you click the follow button in the same box it will take you to my twitter page. Don't follow me. I never tweet. I think it's weird. Sometimes I think I'm too old for social media. I pretty much hate it. Whatever, not the point, the point is that the box will close. Coolbeans! Those boxes are annoying and unless I have to I won't ever use one.</p>

						<p>I tried really hard to do a little animation with the icon in the top left hand corner. I thought it would be cool if it did a little shake on Y axis if you click it, kinda like it was shaking it's head. But I couldn't really get it to look exactly like I wanted and then I fell down a rabbit hole of watching YouTube videos of how people made these really cool CSS animations and then I got discouraged and then confused and then a little sleepy. Blah. Baby steps, I'll get there.</p>

						<p>Not that you asked but I am pretty excited about everything I have learned. Yesterday's homework with the t-shirt boxes I was pretty proud of. I showed it to my mom who randomly showed up at my house today and she didn't seem too impressed by it. But then again the whole reason why she was looking at my computer was because I had to help her with her email. Again. So I guess her opinion shouldn't hold too much weight... still though she's my mom. One day I'll make her a cool website that she won't know how to use.</p>

						<p>Right so blog post concluded. How was it? Was my voice irrevelant and snarky enough? Woof internet.</p>
